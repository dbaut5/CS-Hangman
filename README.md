# CS Hangman
A Python-based Hangman game with a computer science twist using Turtle Graphics to draw the stage. The goal is to create a fun way to reinforce CS terminology through playing a classic game.

## Current Status
- Word bank filled with a few basic CS-related terms
- Core Hangman game logic implemented
- Fully functional Turtle Graphics rendering:
      - Draws the stage and gallows
      - Progressively draws the hanged man as incorrect guesses are made.
  
## Known Issues
- Game does not end properly if the entire word is guessed (ex. entering "program" when the word is program)

## Planned features
- **Hint System**: Show brief definitions or context clues to help players learn as they guess
- **Further Turtle Graphics additions**: Show letters being drawn on the Turtle Graphics window as guesses are made.
